# num -> numerical
# py -> python

# core struture -> ndarray

# list -> slow
#      -> can mixed data store
#      -> value not continous
#      -> static
#      But computer work better with continous data than static
#
# nd array -> continous in memory
#             1    2   3  4
#             101 104 109 113 
#          -> same type (homogeneous)
#             don't need to repetively define data type
#         -> faster
#         -> so we can do vectorized operation
        
# CPU->
#      SIMD-> Single Instruction Multiple Data
#           -> one instruction operate on multiple data
#           -> numpy use this feature of CPU to speed up operation on array



# ex: 5* per element of array
#  here numpy load full array to CPU and
#  do 5* operation on all element at once
 
#  and list will do one by one operation
#   -> numpy is faster    


            #    as ai/ml depends heavily on numerical computation
            #     like:
            #      -> linear algebra
            #      -> math 
            #      -> statistics
            #     -> probability
            #    numpy is very important library for ai/ml
